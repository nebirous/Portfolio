# [David Salguero García](http://soy.nebirous.es/) - Portfolio

In this repository you can find the sourcecode of my portfolio sebsite. On the beginning it was based on the template [Grayscale](<[http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/grayscale)>), by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) but during time I have been modifying it to add different functionalities and aesthetic modiffications.

You can see it live [here](https://nebirous.github.io/Portfolio/)
